[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) enthusiast and always trying to learn more.</br>
Recently doing a few online courses on Machine and Deep learning at [Coursera](http://coursera.org/).

My current repo's are all small-scale Flutter projects, which serve as both a proof-of-concept and continuous training.</br>
Even though they are small, I have plans to improve them in the future. Stay tuned.</br>
I know I _will_ have time someday. I hope so. ðŸ˜… </br>
Translating my repo's Readme's is a work in progress.</br>
